# deep-learning
A deep learning project/library in python. 

Inspired by TensorFlow and the CS231n Stanford course.

+ Basic data and plotting utilities
+ Optimizing algorithms with numerical gradients
+ Chained operations for forward and backward propagation
+ Optimizers working with chained operations
+ Neural network layers (Dense, Softmax, Sigmoid etc)
